# NASDAQHeadlineSentimentAnalysis v0.1
A bot that takes a company name and ticker symbol to display sentiment analysis of their specific headlines in Motley Fool's website.

This was my first real project in python and it works by scraping the Motley Fool's website using the input provided by the user to find the URL for the specified company, and using the Vader Sentiment analysis, it outputs the sentiment value from all the headlines combined.
